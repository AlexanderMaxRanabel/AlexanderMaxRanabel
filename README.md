###   Hello There

I am a small self-taught developer who hates java despite the fact 70% all of his repos are written  in Java.
I Use Windows btw.
I Am Fluent in C++ and C# but im learnin Haskell and Rust.

I am trying to make my own distro named Lambda OS and failed miserably.
My Projects Are:
AlpHax. A Hacked Cient For Minecraft
Seagull. A Reliable and Fast Package Manager[PRIVATE]
CWC OS. My Own Linux Distro which is designed to work with Seagull
